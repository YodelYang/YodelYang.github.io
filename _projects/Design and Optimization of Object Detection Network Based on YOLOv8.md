## Project Details

This project aimed to build a robust object detection system using the YOLOv8 model, optimized for detecting various objects in complex scenes. By improving multi-scale feature fusion and convolution structure in the model's backbone, neck, and head, the optimized model achieved high **mAP50 and mAP50-95** scores on the COCO dataset, demonstrating its applicability in embedded systems and real-time detection tasks.
