This project expanded the classic Minesweeper game to support real-time multiplayer gameplay, built using Python's Flask framework. A web server was set up to handle game requests, with HTTP request handling, thread locking, and API interactions ensuring a smooth, synchronized experience for all players. The game system was thoroughly tested for stability and thread safety.
