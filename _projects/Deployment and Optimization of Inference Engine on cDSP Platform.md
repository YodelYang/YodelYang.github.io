In this NIO joint project, deep learning models were deployed on the cDSP module of vehicle chips for in-car voice systems, achieving over **40% improvement in inference time**. The HiFi-GAN model's operators were analyzed, and deployment was optimized using tools such as ONNX and MACE framework, with quantization and operator fusion methods achieving up to **1.5x acceleration** on Snapdragon DSP modules.
